function n = fromSeveralBases(is, bases)
% n = fromSeveralBases(is, bases)
%
% Gives a number in basis 10 from a list of digit, each of which having a
% different basis.
% 
% Exemple : 21 = 1*(3*4) + 2*(4) + 1 = fromSeveralBases([1 2 1], [2 3 4])
%
% Also accepts several numbers to be changed simultaneously:
% fromSeveralBases([1 2 1; 1 1 1], [2 3 4]) returns [21; 17]
